# Washington-D.C.
### Operation Restoring Valor: The Capital Watchmen
===============================================

**Defending the Seat of Government: A Federal Mandate for Total Security**

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

Washington, D.C. is not just a city; it is the command center of the free world. It is the physical manifestation of our Republic. The buildings that house our laws, the offices that execute our policies, and the officers who stand watch are sacred assets.

Under **Operation Restoring Valor**, we are reigniting the spirit of the **Capital Watchmen**. We are not just patrolling; we are hunting for threats. We are watching the shorelines. We are securing the perimeter. And we are authorized to use overwhelming force to protect the American government from **ANY** attack.

**The Mission: Watching Our Shorelines**
----------------------------------------

The District of Columbia is defined by its waterways---the Potomac and the Anacostia. These are not just rivers; they are the moats of our fortress.

-   **United States Park Police (USPP):** Since 1791, the USPP has been the guardian of federal lands. Their jurisdiction extends to the shorelines, the monuments, and the very ground the capital stands on.

-   **The Mandate:** We need eyes on the water. We need veterans and officers who understand that a threat can come from anywhere. "Watching our shorelines" means total situational awareness. It means that no boat, no drone, and no diver approaches the seat of power without being challenged.

**Aggressive Defense: Protecting Buildings, Offices, and Officers**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no room for hesitation in the defense of the Capital. The **Federal Protective Service (FPS)**, the **Secret Service**, and the **Capitol Police** operate under a clear directive: **Secure the Asset.**

### **1\. The Federal Protective Service (FPS)**

The FPS protects over 9,000 federal facilities. Their motto is "Secure facilities, safe occupants."

-   **Authority:** Under **40 U.S.C. § 1315**, the Secretary of Homeland Security has designated officers to protect these buildings. This is not "mall security." This is federal law enforcement with the power to arrest, investigate, and use force.

-   **The Attitude:** We want officers who are excited to intercept threats. If a criminal thinks they can vandalize a federal office or threaten a government worker, they need to be met with the full weight of federal authority.

### **2\. The Supreme Court & Capitol Police**

The **Supreme Court Police** and **U.S. Capitol Police** have nationwide jurisdiction when protecting their charges.

-   **Zero Tolerance:** An attack on a Justice or a Senator is an attack on the Constitution itself. The response must be immediate and decisive. We are not just "deterring" crime; we are actively seeking out and neutralizing those who would harm our officials.

**Beating Back the Threat: A Call to Action**
---------------------------------------------

We are looking for veterans who miss the clarity of the mission. In Washington, D.C., the mission is simple: **The Government Must Stand.**

-   **No Retreat:** There is no "duty to retreat" when you are guarding the White House or the Capitol. You stand your ground. You hold the line.

-   **Criminals Beware:** If you come to D.C. to loot, burn, or attack, you are not a protester; you are a target set. Our officers are trained to distinguish between dissent and destruction. Destruction will be met with force.

**Conclusion: The Shield of the Republic**
------------------------------------------

**Operation Restoring Valor** is bringing the best of our military tradition to the streets of D.C. We are the **Capital Watchmen**. We watch the shorelines. We guard the doors. And we ensure that the business of the American people continues, uninterrupted by the chaos of those who wish us harm.

**Stand tall. Watch the water. Defend the Capital.**
